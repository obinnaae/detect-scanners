# Boring!
They ask but where does the lonely mind go? I said everything great came from boredom. Convert your boredom into power. Code! Some journal, some just code. So here I will be trying my hands on some coding challenges. Step through the codes and see all the mess I am making. No judgment ):! Please critique as necessary.
